          <h3>Individual Functions Arcade</h3>
          <p>
            This project was an individual project which then we had to improve.<br><br> I improved the arcade by adding more emojis and adding more things to the functions such as a tries variable to the guessing game which allows users to input a value of how many times they want to guess.<br><br> I also changed the canvas background color and font close to my favorite colors. I also added emojis to print statements to add “color” to the game. <br><br>What inspired my changes was my own wishes as I did not have much time to add much to the game such as emojis or some things that I wish some of my group members could have done differently. There was also an issue with the guessing game where there could be multiple answers but only one correct answer was assigned to the answer variable.<br> The hardest part to improve was making sure the point system for rock, paper and scissors was working so that it would print out the correct statement. Adding the tries option for the guessing game was hard as well but I managed to do it. I like the new version as I feel it is a bit more organized and a few more improvements to it. It also feels personal as I included my favorite colors to it.
